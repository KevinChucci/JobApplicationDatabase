# JobApplicationDatabase
I created this application to easily keep track of places I had applied to within a database.

<b>March 17, 2021<b><br/>
  Created repository on GitHub for the application.
  Designed the Home page of the application.
  Created a database named Jobs.
  Added a table to the Jobs database named "applications", and entered test data.
  Added an onClick method for the addJob button.
  Connected the Home page to the database.
  Set up a simple query to test the connection to the database attached to the pressing of the addJob button.
