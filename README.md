# JobApplicationDatabase
I created this application to easily keep track of places I had applied to within a database.

<b>March 17, 2021</b><br/>
  Created repository on GitHub for the application.<br/>
  Designed the Home page of the application.<br/>
  Created a database named Jobs.<br/>
  Added a table to the Jobs database named "applications", and entered test data.<br/>
  Added an onClick method for the addJob button.<br/>
  Connected the Home page to the database.<br/>
  Set up a simple query to test the connection to the database attached to the pressing of the addJob button.<br/>
